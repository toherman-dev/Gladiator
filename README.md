# Gladiator
A small game about gladiators.

This project is an implementation of a programming task given to me at university.
It is a program (or game of sorts) that allows the user to maintain an arena of gladiators with individual skill and armor values, and also simulate fights between them.

## Features
In a graphical user interface, the user can 
- create a new table
- reset the table
- load an existing table
- save the table as a CSV file
- create a new gladiator with a random set of skill and armor values
- delete a gladiator
- start a fight between two non-dead gladiators.

## Localisation
This programs UI is localised completely in german.
